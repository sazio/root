This package contains the source code to reproduce the planar to naturalistic transform described in [1].

If you have problems running the code, please contact
 Daniela Pamplona <pamplona@fias.uni-frankfurt.de>

== Overview ==

The folder functionsAux contains auxiliar functions like changing coordinates, convert radians to degrees etc.
The file run_me.m is an exemplar of using this code, from loading the patch to project it into a sphere, and get the naturalistic input.

== Software dependencies ==
 
* Matlab R2012a (maybe works correctly in older versions)
* Image Processing Toolbox for Matlab

== References ==
